                    <p>Age:16</p>SYNOPSIS:Thirty-two years after stopping the malevolent spirit Vigo, the Ghostbusters have disbanded after a decline in supernatural activities in New York City. Egon Spengler has relocated to Summerville, Oklahoma, where Gozerian cultist Ivo Shandor's mining operations are located. Egon captures a bestial entity from Shandor's mine, aiming to lure a more powerful entity to a painstaking trap in his farm. When the trap's capacitor fails, he hides the ghost trap under his farmhouse's living room floor. Egon struggles with another entity and suffers a fatal heart attack.

Callie, Egon's estranged daughter, and her two children, Trevor and Phoebe, are evicted from their apartment and move to Egon's farm, which he has left to Callie. Trevor meets a local girl, Lucky, and gets a job at the diner where she works. Phoebe is enrolled in a summer science class at a local middle school. Her mentor is eccentric seismologist Gary Grooberson, whom Callie later dates.

Phoebe discovers the house is haunted and finds a PKE meter under Egon's chair. An unseen ghost leads her to the hidden ghost trap, while Trevor finds and repairs the dilapidated Ecto-1 vehicle. Lucky takes Trevor to an old mine shaft with her friends, where they encounter a glowing apparition. Phoebe shows the ghost trap to her new friend, Podcast, and Gary reveals he is a fan of the Ghostbusters, conducting his own investigation on Summerville. Despite not sitting on an epicenter, the town has been consistently experiencing strange earthquakes. Gary, Phoebe, and Podcast tamper with the ghost trap, and the bestial entity, revealed to be one of interdimensional being Gozer's minions, escapes into Shandor's mine.

The ghost haunting Egon's farm leads Phoebe to an underground laboratory where Egon kept his equipment. Realizing the ghost is her grandfather, Phoebe restores the Ghostbusters' proton packs under his direction. She and Podcast test one the next day when they encounter Muncher, an extremotrophic ghost, but it escapes into Summerville. After Phoebe informs Trevor that their grandfather was a Ghostbuster, the trio chase Muncher with the Ecto-1 and capture it. However, they are blamed for the damage caused during Muncher's rampage and the police arrest them, confiscating the Ghostbusters' gear. Phoebe phones Ray Stantz; he explains that when Egon's teammates doubted his belief in a coming apocalypse, he stole the car and gear and moved to Summerville.
